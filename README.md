**Background:**


In this assignment, I learnt to use the methods to complete two Python challenges named PyBank and PyPoll. I have created two folders with the sames name to complete the task.In each folder I have added the follwoing content:
-main.py which will be the main script to run for each analysis. 
-A resource folder that has the CSV files 
-A folder for analysis that has the tect file and results from the analysis. 


**PyBank Task:**

In the PyBank Task, I have created a script to analyze the financial recond of a company. The financial dataset named budget_data.csv was already given. The dataset is composed of two colums: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". 
With these information, the mian goal was to create a python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

-The total number of months included in the dataset

-The net total amount of "profit/losses" in the dataset

-The changes in "Profit/Losseses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

-The greatest increase in profits(date and amount) over the entire period

-The greatest decrease in profits(date and amount) over the entire period


**PyPoll Task:**

The requirment for this task is to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. In order to complete the task a set of poll data named election_data.csv was given. This dataset has three columns such as "Voter ID", "Country", and "Candidate". The mian goal is to create a python script that examine the votes and calcute each of below mentioned values:

-The total number of votes cast

-A complete list of candidates who received votes

-The percentage of votes each candidate won

-The total number of votes each candidate won

-The winner of the election based on popular vote
